* Testcontainers
  ** := testing library with APIs
    *** easy
    *** lightweight
  ** allows
    *** writing tests talking to the same type of services you use in production
without mocks or in-memory services.

* Example:
  ** Java application using a Postgres database

---

== Dependencies

* 'org.postgresql.postgresql'
  ** as Postgres JDBC driver
* 'ch.qos.logback.logback-classic'
  ** for logging
* 'org.apache.maven.plugins.maven-surefire-plugin'
  ** to support JUnit 5 tests
* 'org.testcontainers.postgresql'
  ** module added as test dependency


== Implement business logic

* *CustomerService*
  ** manages customer details.
* *Customer*
  ** is the DTO
* *DBConnectionProvider*
  ** hold JDBC connection parameters and
  ** gets database *Connection*


== Write test using Testcontainers

* Once you run it, you can see in the logs that Testcontainers
  ** If not already locally available -> pull the Postgres Docker image from DockerHub
  ** start the container
  ** executes the test


== Conclusion

* Writing an integration test using Testcontainers === write an unit test
